# Horiseon Social Solutions Services Webpage code refactor

## Description

This code refactor was done to include semantic elements thereby helping to structure the already existing code making it more readable and easier to maintain without disrupting any existing functionality. As you know, semantic elements makes it easier for search engines to find your content and drive traffic to your site and by refactoring this code, that problem has been solved.
